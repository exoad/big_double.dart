# break_infinity.dart
`BigInt` and `double` replacement that can hold up to 1e9e15 for Dart.

Dart port of [Patashu/break_infinity.js](https://github.com/Patashu/break_infinity.js)

## Usage
Install the library

```bash
dart pub add break_infinity
```

or

```bash
flutter pub add break_infinity
```

Import the library into your project

```dart
import "package:break_infinity/break_infinity.dart";
```

_**VoilÃ !**_ For more information on additional usage, read the documentation [here]().

## Compatibility & Limitations

**See [#1](https://github.com/exoad/break_infinity.dart/issues/1)**

This library primarily operates to support both `native` and `web` platforms. These platforms are as follows

> * **Dart Native**: For programs targeting devices (mobile, desktop, server, and more), Dart Native includes both a Dart VM with JIT (just-in-time) compilation and an AOT (ahead-of-time) compiler for producing machine code.
> * **Dart Web**: For programs targeting the web, Dart Web includes both a development time compiler (dartdevc) and a production time compiler (dart2js).
>
> From [dart-lang/sdk](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk)

However, the internal workings of this library depends on `int` and `double`, but the constraints of these [types varies between `web` and `native`](https://dart.dev/language/built-in-types#numbers). Therefore,
when targetting `web`, this library will utilize constants defined with `double` in [lib/src/web/shared.dart](./lib/src/web/shared.dart). On the other hand, when targeting `native`, `int` (64 bit) constants from [lib/src/native/shared.dart](./lib/src/native/shared.dart)
will be used.
